# Fast-Food-Value-Analysis

This Tableau dashboard analyzes popular menu items from six major U.S. fast food chains,
helping consumers identify which meals offer the most nutritional value for their money. By
comparing calories, protein content, and cost per item, the dashboard highlights which chains
offer high-protein, low-cost options and which meals may be overpriced for what they deliver.
